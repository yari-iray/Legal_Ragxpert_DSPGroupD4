I write separately to pick up where the 2 SACKETT v. EPA THOMAS, J., concurring Court leaves off. I The CWA s jurisdictional terms have a long pedigree and are bound up with Congress traditional authority over the channels of interstate commerce. Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 168, and n. 3, 172, 173 174 (2001) (SWANCC). That traditional authority was limited in two ways. First, the water had to be capable of being used as a highway for in terstate or foreign commerce. Second, Congress could reg ulate such waters only for purposes of their navigability by, for example, regulating obstructions hindering naviga ble capacity. By the time of the CWA s enactment, the New Deal era arguably had relaxed the second limitation; Con gress could regulate navigable waters for a wider range of purposes. But, critically, the statutory terms navigable waters, navigable waters of the United States, and wa ters of the United States were still understood as invoking only Congress authority over waters that are, were, or could be used as highways of interstate or foreign com merce. The CWA was enacted, and must be understood, against that key backdrop. A As the Court correctly states, land and water use lies at the core of traditional state authority. Ante, at 23; see also ante, at 2. Prior to Independence, the Crown possessed sov ereignty over navigable waters in the Colonies, sometimes held in trust by colonial authorities. See R. Adler, The An cient Mariner of Constitutional Law: The Historical, Yet Declining Role of Navigability, 90 Wash. U. L. Rev. 1643, 1656 1659 (2013); R. Walston, The Federal Commerce and Navigation Powers: Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County s Undecided Constitutional Issue, 42 Santa Clara L. Rev. 699, 721 (2002) (Walston).

See Al brecht & Nickelsburg, 11047 (explaining that the CWA s legislative his tory is better interpreted as the Supreme Court in SWANCC read it, to mean simply that Congress intended to override previous, unduly nar row agency interpretations to assert its broadest constitutional authority over the traditional navigable waters ); see also S. Bodine, Examining the Term Waters of the United States in Its Historical Context, C. 21 Cite as: 598 U. S. ____ (2023) THOMAS, J., concurring to exert anything more than its commerce power over nav igation. Ibid.; see also id., at 173 (rejecting the Govern ment s argument that the CWA invokes Congress power to regulate intrastate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce ). SWANCC thus interpreted the text of the CWA as imple menting Congress traditional jurisdiction over waters that were or had been navigable in fact or which could rea sonably be so made i.e., the expanded Daniel Ball test. 531 U. S., at 172 (citing Appalachian Elec., 311 U. S., at 407 408).9 And, consistent with the traditional link be tween navigability and the limits of Congress regulatory Boyden Gray Center for the Study of the Administrative State Policy Brief No. 4 (2022). 9Section 404(g), added by the 1977 CWA Amendments, does not demonstrate that the CWA departs from traditional conceptions of navi gability. That provision states that States may administer permit pro grams for discharges into navigable waters (other than those waters which are presently used, or are susceptible to use in their natural con dition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce . . . , including wetlands adjacent thereto). 91 Stat. 1601 (codified, as amended, at 33 U. S. C. 1344(g)).

Reg. 31324. Then in 1977, Congress adopted a new permitting program for a category of waters of the United States. Congress allocated to the Federal Government exclusive authority to issue Clean Water Act permits for dumping dredged or fill material into certain waters of the United States, including wetlands adjacent thereto. 91 Stat. 1601. Through that statutory text, Congress made clear its understanding that waters of the United States included adjacent wetlands and indeed, Congress designed important federal-state permitting authorities around that precise understanding. Congress s 1977 amendment did not merely express an opinion about the meaning of the Clean Water Act; rather, it reflected what Congress understood its own prior acts to mean. Bell v. New Jersey, 461 U. S. 773, 785, n. 12 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, Congress s 1977 decision was no accident. As this Court has previously recognized, the scope of the Corps asserted jurisdiction over wetlands including the Corps decision to cover adjacent wetlands was specifically brought to Congress attention in 1977, and Congress rejected measures designed to curb the Corps jurisdiction. United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U. S. 121, 137 (1985). Subsequently, this Court has recognized that Congress s 1977 amendment made clear that the Act cover[s] wetlands adjacent to navigable waters. Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 167 (2001); see Riverside Bayview, 474 U. S., at 138 ( Congress expressly stated that the term waters included adjacent wetlands ). Not surprisingly, in the years since 1977, no one has whole set of adjacent wetlands. 11 Cite as: 598 U. S. ____ (2023) KAVANAUGH, J., concurring in judgment seriously disputed that the Act covers adjacent wetlands.

699, 721 (2002) (Walston). Upon Independence, this 3 Cite as: 598 U. S. ____ (2023) THOMAS, J., concurring sovereignty was transferred to each of the 13 fully sovereign States. See Martin v. Lessee of Waddell, 16 Pet. 367, 410 (1842) ( [W]hen the Revolution took place, the people of each state became themselves sovereign; and in that char acter hold the absolute right to all their navigable waters and the soils under them for their own common use, subject only to the rights since surrendered by the Constitution to the general government ). Thus, today, States enjoy pri mary sovereignty over their waters, including navigable waters stemming either from their status as independent sovereigns following Independence, ibid., or their later ad mission to the Union on an equal footing with the original States, see Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, 230 (1845) ( The shores of navigable waters, and the soils under them, were not granted by the Constitution to the United States, but were reserved to the states respectively. . . . The new states have the same rights, sovereignty, and jurisdic tion over this subject as the original states ); see also M. Starr, Navigable Waters of the United States State and National Control, 35 Harv. L. Rev. 154, 169 170 (1921). The Federal Government therefore possesses no authority over navigable waters except that granted by the Constitu tion. The Federal Government s authority over certain naviga ble waters is granted and limited by the Commerce Clause, which grants Congress power to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. Art. I, 8, cl. 3. From the beginning, it was understood that [t]he power to regulate commerce, in cludes the power to regulate navigation, but only as con nected with the commerce with foreign nations, and among the states.

In sum, the plain text of the CWA and our opinion in SWANCC demonstrate that the CWA must be interpreted in light of Congress traditional authority over navigable waters. See Albrecht & Nickelsburg 11055 (noting that SWANCC states more than once that Congress use of the term navigable waters signifies that Congress intended to exercise its traditional authority over navigable waters, and not its broader power over all things that substantially affect commerce ). Yet, for decades, the EPA (of its own li cense) and the Corps (under the compulsion of an unrea soned and since discredited District Court order) have is sued substantively identical regulatory definitions of the waters of the United States that completely ignore naviga bility and instead expand the CWA s coverage to the outer limits of the Court s New Deal-era Commerce Clause prec edents. III This case demonstrates the unbounded breadth of the ju risdiction that the EPA and the Corps have asserted under the CWA. The regulatory definition applied to the Sacketts property declares intrastate waters, wetlands, and vari ous other wet things to be waters of the United States if their use, degradation or destruction . . . could affect inter than a negative inference from a parenthetical in a subsection that pre serves state authority, is counterintuitive to say the least. 23 Cite as: 598 U. S. ____ (2023) THOMAS, J., concurring state or foreign commerce. 40 CFR 230.3(s)(3) (2008) (em phasis added). To leave no doubt that the agencies have entirely broken from traditional navigable waters, they give several examples of qualifying waters: those that are or could be used by interstate or foreign travelers for recrea tional or other purposes, those [f]rom which fish or shell fish are or could be taken and sold in interstate or foreign commerce, those that are used or could be used for indus trial purposes by industries in interstate commerce, [t]ributaries of any such waters, and [w]etlands adjacent to any such waters.

  Instruction: Based on the above documents, provide a detailed answer for the user question below.
  Answer "don't know" if not present in the document.
  
user: in what kind of situations is congress allowed to govern the waters of the united states?
**************************************************
** Response: **
assistant: According to the provided documents, Congress has authority over navigable waters for only limited purposes. Specifically, it can regulate and improve navigation.

In Corfield v. Coryell (1823), the court held that Congress' power to govern navigable waters is limited to keeping them open and free from obstructions, as well as removing such obstructions when they exist. Any activity that interferes with or prevents commerce and navigation on these waters may be punished by Congress.

In Gibson v. United States (1897), the court reaffirmed that Congress' authority over navigable waters is limited to control for purposes of navigation. Additionally, technical title to the beds of navigable rivers in the United States is either held by the states or by private landowners as determined by local law.

Furthermore, the documents suggest that Congress can regulate navigable waters only if they are capable of being used as a highway for interstate or foreign commerce. This understanding was established through various court cases, including Gibbons v. Ogden (1824) and Corfield v. Coryell (1823).

In summary, Congress is allowed to govern the waters of the United States in situations where:

1. They are navigable and capable of being used as a highway for interstate or foreign commerce.
2. The regulation is necessary for improving navigation or removing obstructions.

However, activities that merely affect water-based commerce, such as inspection laws, quarantine laws, health laws, or internal state regulations, are not within Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause.

Property owners who negligently discharge pollutants into covered waters may face severe criminal penalties including impris onment. 1319(c). These penalties increase for knowing violations. Ibid. On the civil side, the CWA imposes over $60,000 in fines per day for each violation. See Note follow ing 28 U. S. C. 2461; 33 U. S. C. 1319(d); 88 Fed.

EPA Opinion of the Court Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jointly enforce the CWA. The EPA is tasked with policing violations after the fact, either by issuing orders demanding compliance or by bring ing civil actions. 1319(a).

United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co., 229 U. S. 53, 60 (1913). The River and Harbor Acts of 1890, 1894, and 1899 illus trate the limits of the channels-of-commerce authority. The 1890 Act authorizes the Secretary of War to prohibi[t] the creation of any obstruction, not affirmatively authorized by law, to the navigable capacity of any waters, in respect of which the United States has jurisdiction. 10, 26 Stat. 454. The 1894 Act made it unlawful to deposit matter into any harbor or river of the United States that the Federal Government has appropriated money to improve and pro hibited injuring improvements built by the United States in any of its navigable waters. 6, 28 Stat. 363. Congress consolidated and expanded these authorities in the 1899 Act. Section 10 of the Act prohibits [t]he creation of any obstruction . . . to the navigable capacity of any of the waters of the United States, requires a permit to build structures in any . . . water of the United States, and makes it unlawful to excavate or fill, or in any manner to alter or modify the course, location, condition, or capacity of any water, within the limits of any breakwater, or of the channel of any navigable water of the United States. 30 6 SACKETT v.

85 Fed. Reg. 22340 (2020).

The agencies recently promulgated yet another rule at tempting to define waters of the United States. 88 Fed. Reg. 3004 (2023) (to be codified in 40 CFR 120.2).

905 906 (authorizing grants to research abatement of pollution into any waters ); see Hardy Salt Co. v. Southern Pacific Transp. Co., 501 F. 2d 1156, 1168 (CA10 1974) (noting that Congress only departs from the expanded Daniel Ball test by using clear and explicit lan guage, as it did in parts of the Federal Power Act). 17 Cite as: 598 U.

Reg. 12115. The Corps anchored its jurisdiction in the expanded Daniel Ball test, defining navigable waters to include those waters of the United States which are sub ject to the ebb and flow of the tide, and/or are presently, or have been in the past, or may be in the future susceptible for use for purposes of interstate or foreign commerce. 33 CFR 209.120(d)(1) (1974); see also 209.260(d)(1) (3) (re quiring [p]ast, present, or potential presence of interstate or foreign commerce, [p]hysical capabilities for use by commerce, and [d]efined geographic limits of the water body ). The regulations also made clear that traditional navigability factors were the baseline for CWA jurisdiction: It is the water body s capability of use by the public for purposes of transportation or commerce which is the deter minative factor. 209.260(e)(1). Almost immediately, however, a few courts and the re cently created Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) re jected this interpretation.

91 Stat. 1601 (codified, as amended, at 33 U. S. C. 1344(g)). This provision thus authorizes States to establish their own permit programs over a discrete class of traditionally navigable waters of the United States: those that once were navigable waters of the United States, but are no longer nav igable in fact. See Economy Light & Power Co., 256 U. S., at 123 124. Some have asserted that this nonjurisdictional provision the function of which in the statute is to expand state authority signals that Con gress actually intended an unprecedented expansion of federal authority over the States. Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715, 805 806 (2006) (Stevens, J., dissenting); see also post, at 3 5 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring in judgment); post, at 1 3 (KAGAN, J., concurring in judgment). But, as the Court explains, not only is 404(g) not the relevant definitional pro vision, its reference to wetlands is perfectly consistent with the com monsense recognition that some wetlands are indistinguishable from navigable waters with which they have continuous surface connections. Ante, at 18 22, 27. To infer Congress intent to upend over a century of settled understanding and effect an unprecedented transfer of authority over land and water to the Federal Government, based on nothing more 22 SACKETT v. EPA THOMAS, J., concurring authority, SWANCC noted that any broader interpretation would raise significant constitutional and federalism ques tions and result in a significant impingement of the States traditional and primary authority over land and wa ter use. 531 U. S., at 174. Both in its holdings and in its mode of analysis, SWANCC cannot be reconciled with the agencies sharp departure from the centuries-old under standing of navigability and the traditional limits of Con gress channels-of-commerce authority.

  Instruction: Based on the above documents, provide a detailed answer for the user question below.
  Answer "don't know" if not present in the document.
  
user: are there any limitations that should be noted?
**************************************************
** Response: **
assistant: Yes, according to the provided documents, there are several limitations that should be noted.

Firstly, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers jointly enforce the Clean Water Act (CWA), but their authority is limited to regulating navigable waters for purposes of navigation. This means that activities that merely affect water-based commerce, such as inspection laws, quarantine laws, health laws, or regulations of internal state commerce, are not within Congress' channels-of-commerce authority.

Secondly, the CWA's definition of "waters of the United States" has been subject to various interpretations and revisions over the years. The document mentions that the Corps originally understood the CWA in a narrow way, limiting its jurisdiction to traditional navigable waters as determined by the expanded Daniel Ball test. However, this interpretation was later rejected by some courts and the EPA.

Thirdly, the document notes that the CWA's 404(g) provision authorizes States to establish their own permit programs over traditionally navigable waters of the United States that are no longer navigable in fact. This provision has been cited as evidence that Congress did not intend an unprecedented expansion of federal authority over the states.

Lastly, the document mentions that the agencies' recent rule defining "waters of the United States" is broader than previous definitions and includes traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, territorial seas, their tributaries, adjacent wetlands, intrastate lakes and ponds, streams, or wetlands with a continuous surface connection to categorically included waters or a significant nexus to interstate or traditional navigable waters.

These limitations highlight the complexities and nuances of the CWA's jurisdictional scope and the ongoing debates surrounding its interpretation.
