THE MAVROMMATIS DISPUTE was about the fate of conflicting concessions for the supply of water and electricity and associated economic and political control over Palestine in the interwar period. Both water and electricity were essential to the aspirations of the Jewish people to create a homeland in this inhospitable part of the world. The control over water, in particular, has provoked considerable bloodshed in this region due to water scarcity,2 and remains a central theme of the contemporary Arab Israeli conflict.3 The dispute about the concessions led to the three Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions4 cases before the PCIJ that are the focus of this chapter. As the sole dispute about the British Mandate in Palestine, these three cases provided a catalyst for the PCIJ to address vital constitutional questions concerning the Mandate, including the legislative powers of the Government of Palestine,5 the conformity of such legislation with the British Mandate and the interaction of private law rights and public law from the vantage point of international law that also characterises many contemporary investment disputes.6 34 Michael Waibel 7 Article 95 of the Treaty of Sèvres, 10 August 1920, provided for a mandate for Palestine: The High Contracting Parties agree to entrust, by application of the provisions of Article 22, the administration of Palestine, within such boundaries as may be determined by the Principal Allied Powers, to a Mandatory to be selected by the said Powers. The Mandatory will be responsible for putting into effect the declaration originally made on 2 November 1917 by the British Government, and adopted by the other Allied Powers, in favour of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country. 8 Mandate for the Administration of the Former Turkish Territory of Palestine, conferred upon his Britannic Majesty, confirmed and defined by the League of Nations, 24 July 1922.

Efforts to reach a compromise ultimately proved fruitless. Mavrommatis sought assistance from every possible source in order to further his claim ,45 contacting the British press and Members of Parliament who were sympathetic to his cause. Finally, in 1924, Mavrommatis approached the Greek government to apply on his behalf to Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions 39 46 British Mandate for Palestine (n 31) Art 26. the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ). The Greek government accepted to exercise diplomatic protection. Greece s initial submissions were two-fold: first, the British government lacked the authority to grant the Rutenberg concessions and by doing so had infringed Mavrommatis rights; and, second, according to the Treaty of Lausanne, the British government had taken on responsibility for all of Turkey s obligations, which included the concessions granted to Mavrommatis by the Ottoman authorities. IV. THE PROCEEDINGS AND JUDGMENTS IN MAVROMMATIS A. Judgment No 2 (1924 Jurisdiction) The first Mavrommatis case concerned the jurisdiction of the Permanent Court. Greece s application contended that Britain had failed to recognise the rights of Mavrommatis, a Greek subject, under contracts and agreements concluded by him with the Ottoman authorities, in regard to concessions for certain public works to be constructed in Palestine. Greece submitted the case to the Court under Article 26 of the Mandate for Palestine, which provided for the Permanent Court s jurisdiction, as follows: The Mandatory agrees that, if any dispute whatever should arise between the Mandatory and another Member of the League of Nations relating to the interpretation or the application of the provisions of the Mandate, such dispute, if it cannot be settled by negotiation, shall be submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice provided for by Article 14 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.46 Britain objected that the Court lacked jurisdiction over the dispute. By a narrow majority of seven to five, the Court on 30 August 1924 affirmed its jurisdiction over the Mavrommatis concessions, albeit only with respect to the Jerusalem concessions.

17 Jews and Arabs clashed violently as early as 1921 and again in 1929. 18 R Uerpmann-Wittzack, Mavrommatis Concessions Cases (2013) MPEPIL 1. 19 Mavrommatis Series A, No 2 (n 4) 8. entrepreneur resident in the Ottoman Empire.14 The new concessionaire, Rutenberg, was a Soviet national of Jewish faith who played a major role in the establishment of the state of Israel. At a time of great geopolitical upheaval, the travails of Euripides Mavrommatis with the British authorities in London and Palestine, perhaps due to his nationality, resembled the wanderings of Odysseus.15 Perhaps Mavrommatis was simply on the wrong side of history, and Rutenberg a fortunate benefactor of Great Britain s new commitment to Zionism: the Rutenberg concession, which granted extraordinary monopolistic rights to exploit natural resources and to operate public utilities, was an important milestone in the politics of the economic policy, not only in the prestige it accorded to Zionist movement but also in the violent opposition it provoked.16 During Britain s mandate over Palestine, relations and political and economic divisions between the Jews and Arabs steadily deteriorated,17 culminating in the 1947 48 Civil War that led to Israel s independence. The extent to which Zionism and British policy with respect to the Mandate contributed to this deterioration is disputed. III. THE FACTS OF MAVROMMATIS In 1914, shortly prior to the outbreak of the First World War, Mavrommatis, a Greek national and public works contractor resident in the Ottoman Empire, obtained from the Ottoman authorities two sets of concessions to undertake various public works in Palestine in the cities of Jerusalem, Jaffa, and Jordan. The first set of two concessions, provided under contracts dated 27 January 1914, allowed, first, the construction and working of a system of electric tramways and, second, the distribution of electric light and power and of drinking water in the city of Jerusalem.

206 German Settlers in Poland Series B, No 6 (1923) 36. 207 ibid. Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions 59 in respect of Mavrommatis concessions for Jerusalem and Jaffa. The Greek Government contended that, according to the Treaty of Lausanne, Great Britain, on becoming the mandatory power for Palestine, assumed all of Turkey s obligations, including the electricity franchise granted to Mavrommatis .208 The UK disagreed, contending that the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire by the end of the First World War rendered void Mavrommatis claims. The essence of this British submission is that such a fundamental change of circumstances, the regime change, frustrated the earlier contracts between Mavrommatis and the Ottoman authorities. If correct, later concessions granted to Rutenberg could not breach Mavrommatis rights, since they would be deemed invalid. The Court declined the opportunity to engage in these matters of state succession. 209 Instead, it opted to decide the matter according to the specific applicable provisions of Protocol XII, according to which it had no jurisdiction regarding the Jaffa concessions. However, the Court in Mavrommatis did recognise that Great Britain, succeeding Ottoman rule of Palestine, was bound to recognise certain concessionary rights that Turkey had granted under the general principle of subrogation . 210 It found the Administration of Palestine was bound to recognise the Jaffa concessions based on a general principle of international law211 which admitted no exception.

C. State Succession The Mavrommatis judgments have also been used in support of a rule that concessions granted by the predecessor state bind the successor state.204 As we have seen, the dispute brought the law of state succession as it applied to state contracts to the fore. The tension between major changes in status linked to the passing of territorial sovereignty due to armed conflict and pre-existing economic agreements with private actors was at the core of the Mavrommatis dispute.205 In an earlier decision, in German Settlers in Poland, the Court had determined that private rights acquired under existing law do not cease on a change of sovereignty . 206 Indeed, it had gone so far as to suggest that [e]ven those who contest the existence in international law of a general principle of State succession do not go so far as to maintain that private rights including those acquired from the State as the owner of the property are invalid as against a successor in sovereignty .207 The first Mavrommatis judgment presented the Court with an occasion to develop the law on matters of State succession, having been asked to determine its jurisdiction 201 Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide ( Croatia v Serbia), judgment, 3 February 2015. 202 ibid, [93]. 203 ibid. 204 Uerpmann-Wittzack (n 18) [14]. 205 cf also an important arbitral award on state succession with respect to the Ottoman debt a year after the first Mavrommatis judgment, Affaire de la Dette publique ottomane (Bulgarie, Irak, Palestine, Transjordanie, Grèce, Italie et Turquie), Award, 18 April 1925. Questions of state succession increasingly arise also with respect to contemporary investment treaties.

The Court dismissed that the Protocol would only apply insofar as it was compatible with the Mandate, emphasising that the Protocol as a special and more recent agreement prevailed.189 Conversely, the provisions of the Mandate were held to be applicable in so far as they were compatible with the Protocol .190 Certain provisions of the Protocol clearly affected the jurisdiction of the Court, albeit without proving technically incompatible with Article 11 of the Mandate. Third, the temporal scope of the Court s jurisdiction. In Mavrommatis, Great Britain objected to the PCIJ s jurisdiction on temporal grounds. It alleged that the acts forming the basis of the claim took place before the entry into force of Protocol XII to the Treaty of Lausanne.191 The Court dismissed the objection, considering the Protocol to encompass all disputes whenever they arose, on the grounds that [t]he reservations made in many arbitration treaties regarding disputes arising out of events previous to the conclusion of the treaty seems to prove the necessity for an explicit limitation of jurisdiction .192 The Permanent Court also referred to an important systemic consideration of the treaty s effectiveness, noting that [a]n essential characteristic therefore of Protocol XII is that its effects extend to legal situations dating from a time previous to its own existence .193 If that were not the case, the Court warned, the Protocol would be Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions 57 194 ibid. 195 See Mondev International Ltd v United States of America ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/99/2. 196 cf Article 13 of the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA): An act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the time the act occurs . 197 Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Preliminary Objections) [1996] ICJ Rep.

user: What did the Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions case reveal about the intersection of international law and the sovereignty of mandated territories?
**************************************************
** Response: **
assistant: The Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions cases revealed several important aspects about the intersection of international law and the sovereignty of mandated territories. Firstly, they highlighted the tension between the rights of private individuals under contracts with a predecessor state and the sovereignty of the successor state. The Court's decision in Mavrommatis recognized that concessions granted by the Ottoman authorities to Mavrommatis were binding on Great Britain as the successor state, despite the significant changes in status linked to the passing of territorial sovereignty.

Secondly, the cases demonstrated the importance of considering the specific applicable provisions of international law when determining the rights and obligations of states. In Mavrommatis, the Court declined to engage with matters of state succession, instead opting to decide the matter according to the specific provisions of Protocol XII. This approach emphasized that the Protocol as a special and more recent agreement prevailed over the Mandate.

Thirdly, the cases shed light on the temporal scope of international jurisdiction. The Court in Mavrommatis dismissed Great Britain's objection to its jurisdiction on temporal grounds, considering the Protocol to encompass all disputes whenever they arose. This decision highlighted the importance of an explicit limitation of jurisdiction and the necessity for a treaty's effects to extend to legal situations dating from a time previous to its own existence.

Lastly, the Mavrommatis cases underscored the significance of the general principle of subrogation in international law. The Court recognized that Great Britain, as the successor state, was bound to recognize certain concessionary rights that Turkey had granted under this principle. This decision acknowledged the importance of respecting pre-existing economic agreements with private actors and the continuity of rights acquired under existing law.

In summary, the Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions cases provided valuable insights into the intersection of international law and the sovereignty of mandated territories, highlighting the tension between private rights and state sovereignty, the importance of specific applicable provisions, temporal scope, and the general principle of subrogation.
