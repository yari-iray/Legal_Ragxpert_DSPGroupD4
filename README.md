# DSP Group D4
This repository represents the implementation of a graph-based chatbot. 
It contains an ingestion mechanism which allows users to ingest documents and convert them to a graph, as well as a Neo4j graph retriever whose queries are written using the same model as the chat mechanism, just without the chat context.

## To install:
In the current form, not all packages are explicitly compatible with each other, thus we use a workaround to get all the packages working.

**WARNING: this can break your Python environment, we advise to use a virtual environment.**

#### Installation instructions:
1. Install Python 3.11, version 3.12 is currently not supported by Llama-index and may lead to errors
2. Run `pip install -r DSP_requirements.txt`

There may be errors shown that pip is not taking into account all packages, as not all packages are explicitly compatible with each other. This message may be ignored, as the chatbot will run without issue. If you get any errors from huggingface, make sure to delete the cache folder (/data/huggingface) first before trying anything else.

## Neo4j configuration
- Install Neo4j from the website
- Use the default DMBS from Neo4j, or create a new one
- Ensure that APOC is intalled as a plugin for your DBMS
- Create a new database in the DBMS, the current name in the RAGSettings is `RagChatbot`
- Reset the DBMS password and set a password, the current password in RAGSettings is `password`
